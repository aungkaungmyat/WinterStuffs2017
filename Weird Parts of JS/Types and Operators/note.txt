Types and JS

    -Dynamic Typing: You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figuares it out while your code is running.
    -In JS, an integar value can be assigned to a variable intially set as boolean(dynamic type).

Primitive Types

    -Primitive Type: A type of data that represents a single value. That is not a object.
        1.Undefined - represents lack of existence. Shouldn't set a variable to undefined.
        2.NULL - represents lack of existence. Can set a variable to this.
        3.Boolean - true or false.
        4.Number - Floating point number. The only 'number' type in JS.
        5.String - a sequence of characters. Both ' and " can be used.
        6.Symbol - Used in ES6.

Operators

    -Operator: a special function that is syntactically (written) differently.
          

Operator Precedence and Associativity

    -Opertor Precedence: which operator function gets called first. Functions are called in order of precedence. (HIGHER called first).
    -Associativity: what order operator functions get called in: left-to-right or right-to-left

    -Check opertor precedence pdf for the order. HIGHER ones called first.
        Eg. In, 3 + 4 * 5 -> * called first, then + later, then =.
        Eg. var a = 2, b = 3, c= 4;
            a = b = c;
            All the value in the end will be 4. Because, assignment (=) is right-to-left associativity.

    -JS engine check operator precedence first, if they are in the same order, it checks associativity (left to right or right to left).
